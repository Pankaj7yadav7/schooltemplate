                <p>In order to start with the admission process, we encourage you to make an appointment with our Admission Counsellors telephonically / walk-in / online and visit our campus. Our Admission Counsellors look forward in welcoming you to our campus for providing you with the details about the school, curricular and extracurricular activities and facilitate a tour about the campus.

The parents can purchase the registration form and school prospectus by paying the registration fee Rs 2100/- at the admission cell. Kindly carry two latest Passport size photographs of the child along with a copy of self-attested Date of Birth certificate. The registration fee is neither refundable nor adjustable and it is valid only for the specified academic year. Mere registration is not a guarantee of childâ€™s admission.</p>
                <h4>Step 3 : Registration Form Submission</h4>
                <p>The parent needs to fill up the Registration Form and ensure that all the documents are in order. The following documents need to be submitted along with the Registration Form:
              <ol><li>
                  Copy of the Birth Certificate of the Child</li>

                <h4>Step 4 : School Visit & Interaction/Entrance Exams</h4>
                <p>Parents / Guardians are invited to visit the school campus to understand the culture and ethos of the Institution. A meeting can be scheduled with the class Coordinator / Hostel Superintendent (for boarding house admissions), so that the parents can have an interaction with the Coordinator / Hostel Superintendent, ask questions and collect any information they require.
<br>
                  Each registered child should appear for the interaction/entrance tests which will be based on the academic syllabus of the previous class the child has passed.</p>
                <h4>Step 5: Payment of Fees and Admission Confirmation</h4>
                <p>Once the above steps are satisfactorily completed, parents can proceed with the final step of admission process i.e., pay the applicable fees for their ward to confirm admission.
<ol><li>
  Students are admitted on First Come, First Served basis depending on availability of seats.</li>
  <li>   Selected Students will be required to make the form submission and fee payment within 48 hours of the declaration of the interaction/entrance test results.</li>
  <li> The School fully reserves the right to Admissions and its decision in the matter is final and binding and cannot be questioned.
 </li></ol> Once after the completion of Fee submission and documentation, the admission is confirmed. The school will communicate with the parents via SMS/email to intimate about reopening of academic session, books and uniform details and about further formalities, to be completed, if any.</p>
                <h4>Step 6: Parent Orientation Program</h4>
                <p>There will be a parent orientation program before the beginning of the new academic session. This program will acquaint the parents with the Vision, Mission & Ethos of the school.
<br>
                  All new entrants are required to produce a medical certificate certifying that they are free from any contagious or infectious disease and are otherwise physically fit to be admitted to a residential school. The parents must fill up Health Record provided by teacher and return it as soonest.</p>
